# Migration Plan: VoxedAI Frontend Functionality Migration

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for migrating functionality from the original components to the newly designed UI. The goal is to maintain the new UI aesthetic while implementing all existing functionality.

## Overview

The migration will focus on these major components:
- Sidebar
- Chat
- VoxPilot
- Notes
- Code

Each component requires specific functionality to be carried over from the original codebase while preserving the new UI design. We'll use dynamic variables from index.css to ensure proper light/dark mode support throughout.

## Phase 0: Supabase Migration

### 0.1 Workspace

Ensure workspace uses the real supabase data to populate the workspace selector and the space gallery

**Tasks:**
- [x] Migrate/use the supabase functions for getting and populating all data
- [x] Ensure ui populates with this data
- [x] Implement the management functions delete, edit, create, etc.
- [x] Ensure state management is maintained so later components know what the selected space is
- [x] Check console logs for any errors
- [x] Take screenshot of working sidebar with files

**Implementation Notes:**
- Integrated the existing supabase functions from workspaceService.ts into the new UI
- Added proper TypeScript types to fix linter errors
- Implemented workspace creation, deletion, and selection functionality
- Added state management for workspaces and spaces
- Implemented real data fetching for spaces based on selected workspace
- Connected space creation to Supabase using createSpaceWithWorkspace
- Maintained the new UI aesthetic while implementing the functionality
- Fixed workspace filtering to properly handle "All" selection
- Added workspace path display in space cards
- Added delete buttons for workspaces in the dropdown menu
- Implemented "Include nested spaces" toggle functionality to show spaces from child workspaces
- Improved UX by hiding the "Include nested spaces" toggle for workspaces without children

### 0.2 App.tsx Route Management

The application routes need to be updated to properly work with the new UI components.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Update App.tsx to import the correct new page components
- [x] Fix the existing linter errors in App.tsx regarding missing imports
- [x] Ensure routes are properly set up for all components
- [x] Implement proper authentication flows with the new UI components
- [x] Test navigation between different screens
- [x] Ensure routing uses correct supabase ids and id state is maintained between components
- [x] Check console logs for any errors
- [x] Take screenshot of working navigation

**Implementation Notes:**
- Updated App.tsx to use the new UI components
- Fixed import paths and component names
- Maintained the existing authentication flows
- Ensured proper routing between components
- Preserved the lazy loading for better performance
- Verified that navigation works correctly with real Supabase IDs

## Phase 1: Sidebar Migration

### 1.1 File Management System Setup

- [x] Actually populate the notes list in @Note.tsx with the real notes from the db. Remove fake data
- [x] Make a create note modal that exepts a title, description, and related files. This info will be stored in the metadata jsonb column of the space_files table. Still keep the unique file_name generation
- [x] Update the ui to use the name from the metadata for display purposes
- [x] Use the same setup from the old @NotesPanel.tsx file to have a note editor which opens when an individual note is clicked (either in sidebar or in list)
